In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## User Story Testing

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

| User Story | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| As a new site user, I would like to simply navigate through the site, so that I can accsess the page I want quickly. | ![screenshot](../dressage_club/documenation/navbar-desktop.png) |

| As a new site user, I would like to use an easy signup form, so that I can be assured I have signed up.| ![screenshot](../dressage_club/documenation/desktop-signup-page.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to view and use the site on my moible, tablet or desktop, so that I can have full access.| ![screenshot](../dressage_club/documenation/mobile-home-page.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to use the contact info in the footer multiple times.| ![screenshot](../dressage_club/documenation/footer-icons.png) |
|As a site administrator, I should have easy read HTML an CSS code so that other developers can work with the code. | ![screenshot](../dressage_club/documenation/w3-validator.png) |

## Bugs


-Bug in signup form. Fixed on Jan 19th, 2024.

    ![screenshot](../dressage_club/documenation/bug-signup.png)

    - To fix this, I corrected the id names and validation.

- Bug in dropdown option section of the form. Fixed in Jan 19th, 2024.

    ![screenshot](../dressage_club/documenation/bug-form.png)

    - To fix this, I added correct values to each option.

- Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug03.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Django `TemplateDoesNotExist` at /appname/path appname/template_name.html

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug04.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `E501 line too long` (93 > 79 characters)

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug04.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

## Unfixed Bugs

- The container of the navbar links  

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.
